  abstract = {The National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML) conducted 152 aerial surveys in Cook Inlet, Alaska from 2003-2005 to understand the seasonal abundance and distribution of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii). Surveys were flown in August, October, April and June to coincide with breeding and pupping (June), molting (August) and non-breeding periods (October and April). The effects of seasonal and environmental variables (covariates) on the numbers of harbor seals hauled out during surveys were assessed using a generalized linear model. The final fitted model of harbor seal counts provided a measure the magnitude of seasonal changes in harbor seals hauled out in the study area. The adjusted counts and standard errors of harbor seals in the study area for each season were 2,635 (257) for April; 7,111 (313) for June; 8,301 (292) for August; and 2,407 (454) for October. Kachemak Bay and Kamishak Bay were two regions with consistently high numbers of seals ashore across all seasons. Additional areas with relatively high numbers in some seasons were the mouth of Iliamna Bay, Augustine Island, Redoubt Bay and the sandbars north and south of Kalgin Island. In general, areas with high numbers of seals in June also had large numbers of pups. The results presented in this report provide a solid foundation for understanding the seasonal distribution and abundance of seals ashore and can aid planning agencies in reducing, avoiding, or responding to impacts from human activities. Analysis of data from satellite-linked geo-location and dive-recorder tags, obtained in Task III of this study, will complement these results by providing measures of habitat use at sea. Haul-out time lines, also obtained from satellite tags, will allow estimation of the total abundance of harbor seals in Cook Inlet, in contrast to the abundance ashore that we estimated from the aerial surveys alone.},

  abstract = {Harbor seals are particularly vulnerable to acute and chronic environmental impacts, such as those that could result from industrial accidents such as oil spills. Previous studies of the haul-out behavior of harbor seals in Alaska have been conducted in August, to coincide with the seals' molting period. Haul-out patterns at other times of year are not well known, although long-term, land-based studies have been conducted at a few selected sites, primarily during summer months. Visual counts of seals made by observers at these field sites can be useful for recording haul-out patterns during selected times of the year, however, obtaining daily counts at multiple haul-out sites over many months to a year would be extremely labor intensive and costly. A thorough description of changes in harbor seal haul-out behavior in a region as large as Cook Inlet requires a different approach than has been used in the past. The advent of high-resolution digital cameras with large memory capacities and low power consumption has enhanced the prospects for using relatively low cost time-lapse photography for long-term monitoring of wildlife and other natural resources in remote locations. We developed and assembled a digital time-lapse photography system from commercially available components, and used the system from 2003 to 2005 to assess harbor seal haul-out behavior year-round at five haul-out sites in Cook Inlet. The primary objective of this project was to identify factors that impacted the haul-out behavior of harbor seals in Cook Inlet and to quantify the relationship between haul-out patterns and these factors. Fourteen remote time-lapse camera systems were deployed in 2003-2004 at the following five harbor seal haul-out sites: Aurora Rock, Anchor Point, and Augustine Island East, West-1 and West-2. After deployment, however, a few key factors prevented us from completing the majority of our objectives. The greatest obstacle to success of this project was the unreliability of the camera/controller combination that we selected. Even with frequent maintenance visits, one or more cameras at each site continued to fail for unknown reasons, and as a result we obtained only partial photographic coverage of the haul-out sites. Without accurate hourly seal counts, we were unable to address the original objectives of this project and relate the numbers of seals on a haul-out to specific covariates such as weather conditions, tidal height, time of day, and date in seasonal life-history cycle. The original objectives, however, were met even more effectively by addition of Task III to this project, which enabled satellite-tagging of a large sample of harbor seals; the satellite tags provided detailed haul-out time lines that will be analyzed to identify and describe the key factors in harbor seal haul-out behavior and to estimate total abundance from aerial survey counts of seals ashore. Additional considerations for the use of time-lapse photography for investigation of harbor seal haul-out patterns are ensuring complete photographic coverage of the haul-out area and good photographic quality. If a more technically sound solution for a camera/controller combination becomes available, these issues will also need to be addressed in any future study.},

  abstract = {Between 2004 and 2006 we conducted four harbor seal tagging trips in Cook Inlet during the months of October and May. In total, we captured and released 93 harbor seals, 77 of which were tagged with satellite transmitters. Each transmitter was glued to the hair on the back of the seal using durable epoxy. Fourteen of the seals were also equipped with specially developed transmitters that were attached to one of the rear flippers. Transmissions from the 91 tags resulted in 178,536 location estimates and 310,593 dive and haul-out behavior records. These data formed the basis for the development of novel analysis techniques. Johnson et al. (2008) described a novel continuous-time correlated random walk (CTCRW) method for predicting animal locations from satellite tags. Higgs and Ver Hoef (2011) described a new statistical method for analyzing dive behavior based on dive histogram recordings obtained from satellite tags. This report demonstrates the application of the CTCRW model to provide estimates of seasonal changes in behavior and use patterns for harbor seals in Cook Inlet and Gulf of Alaska. Harbor seals tagged in central and southern Cook Inlet ranged as far southwest as the Semidi Islands and some seals used habitats around the north and northeast side of Kodiak Island. There was a strong seasonal pattern of more coastal and restricted spatial use during the spring and summer (breeding, pupping, molting) and more wide-ranging movements within and outside of Cook Inlet during the winter months. Three trip statistics (trip length, trip duration and net trip distance) were examined as response variables in a mixed linear model. All age and sex classes showed a drop in trip duration and length during the pupping and breeding season. Adult female trips were the shortest in length and duration during the month of June (when many are likely tending a pup). Analysis comparing seasonal dive behavior of a single adult female (AF) harbor seal and a juvenile male (JM) harbor seal showed similar results. Dive activity for the adult female was reduced in the month of June. Haul-out behavior also varied seasonally with the proportion of seals hauled out peaking at 0.43 in June compared to 0.32 in October. Combining the previously reported survey counts with these haul-out proportions resulted in a peak seasonal abundance of 23,954 (SE: 1576) seals in August compared to 10,820 (SE: 1240) in April. These insights into seasonal harbor seal movements, behavior and abundance are critical for understanding foraging ecology, marine habitat use, and risk of impacts from industrial accidents such as oil spills.},

This report provides information on the marine mammal stocks of Alaska under the jurisdiction of the National Marine Fisheries Service. Each stock assessment includes, when available, a description of the stock's geographic range; a minimum population estimate; current population trends; current and maximum net productivity rates; optimum sustainable population levels and allowable removal levels; estimates of annual human-caused mortality and serious injury through interactions with commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries, takes by subsistence hunters, and other human-caused events (e.g., entanglement in marine debris, ship strikes); and habitat concerns.
