  abstract = {The analysis of animal movement and resource use has become a standard tool in the study of animal ecology. Telemetry devices have become quite sophisticated in terms of overall size and data collecting capacity. Statistical methods to analyze movement have responded in kind, becoming ever more complex, often relying on state-space modeling. Estimation of movement metrics such as utilization distributions (UDs), however, have not followed suit, relying primarily on kernel density estimation. Here we consider a method for making inference about space use that is free of all of the major problems associated with kernel density estimation of UDs such as autocorrelation, irregular time gaps, and error in observed locations. Our proposed method is based on a data augmentation approach that defines use as a summary of the complete path of the animal, which is only partially observed. As opposed to other Bayesian movement modeling papers we use an importance sampling as the basis of our computation instead of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This allows processing of large numbers of animals. We demonstrate the predictive approach by estimating behavioral metrics such as trip distances, variations in speed during a trip and spatial maps of diving intensity for female northern fur seals in the Pribilof Islands, Alaska and harbor seals in the Cook Inlet region of Alaska.},

  abstract = {Satellite tags (n=68) were deployed on bearded (Erignathus barbatus; n=7), ribbon (Histriophoca fasciata; n=39) and spotted seals (Phoca largha; n=22) in the Bering and Chukchi seas between 2007 and 2012. The tags provide Argos location estimates and summarized dive behavior data. Seal use was predicted using a continuous-time correlated random walk and documented different seasonal patterns of spatial across species. Additionally, we expanded the analysis to include dive behavior data to illustrate further differences. Predicted locations were temporally matched with dive records and a quasi-weighted kernel density analysis was employed to estimate a density surface reflective of both space use and dive behavior. A novel jack knife approach was used to optimize kernel bandwidth to better reflect population level use patterns. Ribbon seal dive behavior (200-600+ m) was more intense along the Bering Sea shelf break and deeper waters while spotted and bearded seals limited their dive behavior ({$<$}200 m) to the shallower, on-shelf habitat. The spatial variability in dive behavior across these species is an important component of understanding and predicting responses of ice-associated seals to changes in sea-ice and other elements of their marine ecosystems as a result of future climate change.},

  abstract = {The seasonal timing of key, annual life history events is an important component of many species' ecology. Seasonal periods important to marine mammals often do not align well with typical labels (i.e., spring, summer, winter, fall). The timing of key life history events is well documented only for species found in accessible rookeries or breeding areas. Our knowledge of seasonal timing for species widely dispersed in inaccessible or remote habitats is poor. Here, we employed data from biologging sensors and new statistical modeling to identify and estimate timing of seasonal states for ribbon (n=82) and spotted seals (n=46) in the Bering Sea. These seals are reliant on the seasonal sea ice for pupping, nursing, breeding and molting and these seasons can be characterized by more time spent hauled out on ice and by changes in dive behavior. We are especially interested in the pupping-breeding-molting season, but also used this approach to identify seasonal structure in the non-breeding period. Seasonal periods were treated as separate behavior states that correspond to a hidden Markov process. Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used to estimate behavior states (e.g., foraging, resting, transit) from telemetry data. Typical HMMs, however, have no temporal memory of state assignments and would likely not capture seasonal level states. To address this, we applied a new approximation to a hidden semi-Markov model and specified the transition matrix for the states to mimic the sequential timing of seasons. Dive and haul-out behavior from biologgers were used to estimate these states. The timing and extent of sea ice in the Bering Sea is predicted to change dramatically over the next 50 years and we anticipate ribbon and spotted seals might adjust the timing of these life history events in response to those changes.},

  abstract = {Ice-associated seals rely on sea ice for a variety of activities, including breeding, molting, pupping, and rest. In the Arctic, many of these activities occur in spring and early summer as sea ice begins to melt and retreat northward. Rapid acceleration of climate change in Arctic ecosystems is thus of concern, as the quantity and quality of suitable habitat is forecast to decrease. Here, we use data collected from bio-loggers deployed between 2005 and 2017 to investigate the seasonal timing and environmental factors affecting sea ice use by bearded, ribbon, and spotted seals in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas. In addition to providing baseline data on phenology, these data also allow us to refine availability estimates needed to accurately estimate abundance from aerial survey counts of seals basking on ice. Using generalized linear mixed pseudo-models to properly account for temporal autocorrelation, we fit models with a variety of covariates (e.g., day-of-year, solar hour, age-sex class, wind speed, barometric pressure, temperature, precipitation) to explain variation in haul-out records. We found evidence for strong diurnal and seasonal patterns in haul-out behavior, as well as strong weather effects (particularly wind and temperature). In general, seals were more likely to bask on ice mid-day and when wind speed was low and temperatures were higher. Haul-out propensity increased through March and April, peaking in May and early June before declining again. The timing and frequency of haul-out events also varied based on species and age-sex class. For ribbon and spotted seals, models with year effects were highly supported, indicating that the timing and magnitude of haul-out behavior varied among years. This analysis suggested a large degree of plasticity in the timing of annual haul-out peaks, indicating they may have the ability to adapt breeding, molting, and pupping to environmental conditions.},
